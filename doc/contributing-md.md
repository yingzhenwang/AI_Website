## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * üíö `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript code is linted with ESLint and formatted with Prettier.

* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
* Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  export const foo = 'bar';
  
  // Instead of:
  const foo = 'bar';
  export { foo };
  ```
* Place imports in the following order:
    * External packages (e.g., 'react')
    * Internal modules (using relative paths)
* Place class properties in the following order:
    * Class methods and properties (methods starting with `static`)
    * Instance methods and properties
* Use arrow functions over anonymous function expressions.
* Use destructuring where it makes code clearer.

### Python Styleguide

* Follow PEP 8 style guide
* Use consistent docstring style (preferably Google style)
* Use f-strings for string formatting
* Use type hints where appropriate
* Keep functions and methods short and focused on a single responsibility
* Use meaningful variable names

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use Markdown for documentation.
* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{className}` and `{methodName}` syntax.
* Include code samples where appropriate.
* Document all public APIs.
